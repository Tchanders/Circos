# Circos

## 2DO for the info panel

1. Somehow move the legened in the popup display

2. ALl the rest

## General 2DO

1. Some of the scripts are getting large. Maybe split them up in individual modules?

2. We ~~should probably~~ __need to__ write a generalised solr post module. I will try to put something together Monday 4/5.

3. Button that saves, gene or OG ids from a specific cluster along with info (p-value ?), to a text file.

4. CSS cleanup.
